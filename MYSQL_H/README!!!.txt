If you need to recompile the DLL, somehow with my_sql.h something wrong. 
So use the some of the blocks like __int64 redefined in the header and FILETIME was giving errors. 
Therefore that part closed in header file and worked. 
The header file put under the code under the library MY_SQL_H folder.
